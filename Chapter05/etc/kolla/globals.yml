# Ansible options
###################

## Use ubuntu as base OS runtime for Kolla container images

# Valid options are ['centos', 'debian', 'rocky', 'ubuntu']
kolla_base_distro: "ubuntu"

## Use the Master default stable branch - changing the release name must be carefully checked in the local or remote remote branch
# Do not override this unless you know what you are doing.
openstack_release: "master"

# This should be a VIP, an unused IP on your network that will float between
# the hosts running keepalived for high-availability. If you want to run an
# All-In-One without haproxy and keepalived, you can set enable_haproxy to no
# in "OpenStack options" section, and set this value to the IP of your
# 'network_interface' as set in the Networking section below.
kolla_internal_vip_address: "10.0.0.47"


########################
# Nova - Compute Options
########################
## Make sure the selected hypervisor in the host is installed properly 

# Valid options are [ qemu, kvm, vmware ]
nova_compute_virt_type: "kvm"


##############################
# Neutron - Networking Options
##############################
# This interface is what all your api services will be bound to by default.
# Additionally, all vxlan/tunnel and storage network traffic will go over this
# interface by default. This interface must contain an IP address.
# It is possible for hosts to have non-matching names of interfaces - these can
# be set in an inventory file per host or per group or stored separately, see
#     http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html
# Yet another way to workaround the naming problem is to create a bond for the
# interface on all hosts and give the bond name here. Similar strategy can be
# followed for other types of interfaces.

## Make sure to enter the actual name of network interface shown in your Operating System
network_interface: "eth0"

# This is the raw interface given to neutron as its external network port. Even
# though an IP address can exist on this interface, it will be unusable in most
# configurations. It is recommended this interface not be configured with any IP
# addresses for that reason.

## Make sure to enter the actual name of network interface shown in your Operating System
neutron_external_interface: "eth1"

# Valid options are [ openvswitch, ovn, linuxbridge, vmware_nsxv, vmware_nsxv3, vmware_nsxp, vmware_dvs ]
# if vmware_nsxv3 or vmware_nsxp is selected, enable_openvswitch MUST be set to "no" (default is yes)
# Do note linuxbridge is *EXPERIMENTAL* in Neutron since Zed and it requires extra tweaks to config to be usable.
# For details, see: https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-experimental-framework.html

## Install OpenvSwitch as main Neutron plugin for this chapter and next ones
neutron_plugin_agent: "openvswitch"

# Swift - Object Storage Options
################################

## # This parameter defines matching pattern: if "strict" mode was selected,
# for swift_devices_match_mode then swift_device_name should specify the name of
# the special swift partition for example: "KOLLA_SWIFT_DATA", if "prefix" mode was
# selected then swift_devices_name should specify a pattern which would match to
# filesystems' labels prepared for swift.

## Default is 'strict' mode. 
# swift_devices_name: "KOLLA_SWIFT_DATA"

## If you have labeled hard disks with eg objdisk1, objdisk2, objdisk3, use the following settings: 
## swift_devices_match_mode: "prefix"
## swift_devices_name: "objdisk"

## Use local or remote  Custom docker registry as demonstrated in Chapter 2: Kicking Off the OpenStack Setup â€“ The Right Way (DevSecOps)
docker_registry: 10.0.0.15:4000

## Not recommended configuration. The option will allow to use pull/push Docker images without a Certificate Authority. Make sure to install a TLS certificate to reach the Docker registry in production environments. The option is set to false for the sake of demonstration.
## More information can be found at https://docs.docker.com/registry/
docker_registry_insecure: "yes"
