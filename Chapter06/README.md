# Chapter 06
## OpenStack Networking â€“ Connectivity and Managed Service Options

## Description

The Chapter extends and uses the deployment of a multi-node OpenStack environment as described in [Chapter03](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/tree/main/Chapter03):
- Configure OpenStack networking using OpenvSwitch (OVS) mechansim.
- Configure OpenStack networking using Open Virtual Network (OVN) mechansim.
- Configure OpenStack networking for dynamic routing.
- Enable Neutron Load Balancer as Service (LBaaS) plugin.



### System and Software Specs:

The chapter uses the same hardware and configuration for multi-node OpenStack setup as deployed in [Chapter03](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/tree/main/Chapter03):

| Hostname |vCPUs| RAM | Disk Space | Network Interfaces| Role 
|------|----|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| `cc01.os` |`8`| `128GB` | `250GB` | `4 x 10GB` | Cloud Controller| 
| `cn01.os` |`12`| `240GB` | `500GB` | `4 x 10GB` | Compute Node|  
| `net01.os` |`4`| `32GB` | `250GB` |`4 x 10GB` | Network Node| 
| `storage01.os` |`4`| `32GB` | `1TB` |`4 x 10GB` | Storage Node| 

> [!NOTE]
> The mentioned resources are being used in large production environments. Feel free to adjust the specs based on available resources you have but staying with minimum requirements to avoid performance issues. 



The chapter uses the different tools and software versions:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **kolla-ansible**: Latest and stable version from OpenStack Git master branch  (_Description in next section_)
- **Python**: Version 3.X.X
- **Ansible Core**: Any version between ```2.16```  and ```2.17.99```.
- **Jenkins**: Any version for the latest Ubuntu/Debian Jenkins repository (_Description in next section_)



### Code - How-To:

The Chapter uses the kolla-ansible community [repostority](https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible).

Make sure you followed instructions to setup Jenkins and CI/CD pipeline for kolla-ansible deployment in [Chapter02](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/tree/main/Chapter02#3setting-up-the-cicd-pipeline)

Required files are:
- ```ansible/inventory/multi_packtpub_prod``` : Inventory file for multi-node setup
- ```/etc/kolla/globals.yaml``` : OpenStack configurations and parameters 

You can check the branch naming standard used by the OpenStack community in the Github page by clicking on the Switch branches/tags button the top right of the page:

![Branch Naming](IMG/Branches-Names-Standards.png)

Branches with **stable/** prefix are still maintained. Non maintained OpenStack releases are named with branches with **unmaintained/** prefix.

```sh
....
###################
# OpenStack options
###################
...
enable_octavia: "yes"
octavia_network_interface: eth0
octavia_auto_configure: "yes
...
```

2. Add the corresponding `octavia` services in `/ansible/inventory/multi_packtpub` inventory file if not assigned yet. `Octavia` `API`, `Driver Agents`, `Health Manager`, `Housekeeing` and  `Worker` services will be running on the `Cloud Controller` node. The updated inventory file can be found [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/blob/main/Chapter04/ansible/inventory/multi_packtpub_prod):

```sh
...
[octavia:children]

octavia
[octavia-driver-agent:children]
octavia
[octavia-health-manager:children]
octavia
[octavia-housekeeping:children]
octavia
[octavia-worker:children]
octavia
...
```


3.  Run the deployment using the  Jenkins Pipeline as described in [Chapter03](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/blob/main/Chapter03/README.md#deployment-configuration). The Pipeline uses the stages provided [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-OpenStack-Third-Edition/blob/main/Chapter03/Jenkinsfile):
